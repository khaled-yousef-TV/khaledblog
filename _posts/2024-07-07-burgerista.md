## Unexpected Detours are always the best 

 It was day two of our road trip, which involved us driving back and forth between Upper Austria and Styria, we were attending the F1 race in The beautiful hills of Styria and we had zero plan, the events that unfolded next also showed that we had no idea what we were doing, but we were just going with the flow, this notion always makes me laugh, we get caught up into thinking we are in control of things only for life to slap us with its spontaneous nature and humbles us with by demonstrating how little control we really have, so kick back and just enjoy the ride.

 Qualifying day (day 2 of F1 race weekends) is usually not the most exciting but this one had the sprint race which is a mini race compared to the full distance one, it's a new concept introduced to spice up F1 race weekends, lights out were at 12, at 11:30 we were arguing on which route to take to get there quicker, we took the "faster" route but ended up on the complete opposite side of the track, and there was a huge queue for getting in, so we were sure it was all over for us catching the race, but for some reason my friend decided to YOLO it and talk in Arabic to the security guy who turned out to be from Egypt and like the nicest dude ever.   

 He really let us in the most expensive section zero questions asked, and the bond that developed between us there was something that restored my faith in humans, here was this guy who never saw us in his life and would probably never see us again deciding to help us out which saved us lots of headaches and trouble and passive aggressiveness on whose fault was it that we were late.

 Anyway, I'm going off-track here (pun definitely intended), we enjoyed the race and headed back home and you would think that this would be the highlight of the weekend but nope, life again tells me to sit down and listen up because the day after I was gonna get served a godly plate of goodness with a great side of fries.

 The day after we went to the jew's castle (it's literally called that in German), and there we went to a cafe/restaurant whose owner/cook/waitress is the nicest person ever, she spoke to us in german and asked us if Max was gonna win and hyped us up for the race, then proceeded to serve us a burger like no other, Very juicy patty, covered with local cheese, and some greenish vegetable that you will see in the picture below, I have no idea what this thing is called but it was so delicious.

 You would take one bite, this greenish pieces would slip away from your mouth, mixed with the juicy meat and the homemade special sauce which was the star of the dish for sure, this burger took me again through space and time, I felt I was simultaneously 1 and 100 years old, it's always funny to me how there must be places like this where such good food exists that no one knows about, if we weren't the biggest unassuming F1 fans we would have never experienced this, after this meal we went to the race and hit the road one more time to round up the weekend.

 This was an amazing weekend and served again as a reminder that how often I try to plan and scheme, it's so relieving knowing that there's this sense of unpredictability where things can turn to the better or to the worse any second, this adds so much more to life and spices it up, this is it for this time anticipate the next meal post soonish.
