## Unexpected Detours are always the best 

 It was day two of our road trip, which involved us driving back and forth between Upper Austria and Styria, we were attending the F1 race in The beutiful hills of Styria  and we had zero plan, the events that unfolded next also showed that we had no idea what we were doing but were just going with the flow.
 Qualifying day (day 2 of F1 race weekends) is usually is not the most exciting but this one had the sprint race which is a mini race compared to the full distance one, it's a new concept introduced to spice up the F1 race weekends, lights out were at 12, at 11:30 we were arguing on which route to take to get there faster, we took the "faster" route but ended up on the complete opposite side of the track, and there was a huge queue for getting in, so we were sure it was all over for us catching the race, but for some reason my friend decided to YOLO it and talk in Arabic to the security guy who turned out to be from Egypt and like the nicest dude ever.
