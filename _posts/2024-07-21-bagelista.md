## Sleeping in can have its benefits as well  

Today we were in Vienna!!! Vienna will always have a special place in my heart as it was the first city I visited in Europe, It took an inexperienced 22 student in with open arms and asked no questions, I still remember walking out of the subway station and hearing someone playing the violin and in my head that was exactly how I imagined a culturally rich city like Vienna to sound like, and it made me feel some kind of way as I still get a giddy feeling whenever I get to visit, which is why I was super excited about this trip.
A couple of friends from home were visiting and as I am the "Austrian" already having lived here for more than 6 months and had to host them in my country apparently, which is something I self admittedly love to do, Austria has given me so much and the least I could do is to represent it and paint it in a good light.
Keep in mind, this trip did not start and was not exclusive to Wien, but there we had our highlight food of it FOR SURE,
