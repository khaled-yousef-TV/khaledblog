## Sleeping in can have its benefits as well  

Today we were in Vienna!!! Vienna will always have a special place in my heart as it was the first city I visited in Europe, It took an inexperienced 22 year old student in with open arms no questions asked, I still remember walking out of the subway station and hearing someone playing the violin and in my head that was exactly how I imagined a culturally rich city like Vienna to sound like, and it made me feel some kind of way as I still get giddy whenever I get to visit, which is why I was super excited about this trip.

A couple of friends from home were visiting and as I am the "Austrian" already having lived here for more than 6 months and had to host them in my country apparently, which is something I self admittedly love to do, Austria has given me so much and the least I could do is to represent it and paint it in a good light.
Keep in mind, this trip did not start and was not exclusive to Wien, but there we had our highlight food of it FOR SURE, and this time it came from the U.S (At least that's where I thought Bagels came from).

As it has been for the past few days, We agree that we will leave early, go to bed at 12, only to spend the next two hours laughing our asses off, it was such a nice throwback to spending the night over at your best friend's place, where his parents would not allow you to stay late so you keep giggling underneath the sheets and hoping not to get caught, due to these reasons we ended up sleeping in on Sunday even though the room felt like an oven, this again led to a panicky morning were we had to rush to find a nice breakfast spot, our first option was a tiny hipster place where we could have a quick breakfast and it was 15 mins away by foot and so we began our march (a 15 min walk is a lot for us Jordanians) but we quickly found it that the street we were taking was filled with hippy breakfast spots, so we decided to wing it and ended up at this bagel place (The English menu was one of the main reasons we sat down).

> “a 15 min walk is a lot for us Jordanians”

It was a corner shop, and I cannot emphasize enough how much I love corner shops since it's the end of one street but the beginning of another and this in a weird way always makes me hopeful and I always see it as a metaphor that life goes on, so there we were, overlooking new beginnings and our menu, which was super delightful, so the whole place's theme was bagels, you see when you say you are a bagel shop you gotta deliver and boy did this place deliver, the highlight was for sure the omelette bagel they had which I sadly did not order, but what I did end up ordering was a french bagel or that's what they called it at least, it had freshly cut pears soaked with honey and the most succulent cream cheese, the taste was so heavenly, the creamness of the , well, the cream cheese alongside the sweetness of the fruit had such a lovely balance, combined with the nice weather and Vienna's charm, this made for a very pleasurable meal, my buddies also enjoyed their's and all in all it was an awesome experience, we followed this up with an epic lunch but that is probably a story for another day.
