## I wish I got caught in tourist traps more often

Hi there, 
This is my first blog post so please bear (or whichever animal of your choosing) with me, I wanna take you on a journey with my food choices, there will be ups there will be downs and there will be stuff that make us go around in circles, I hope you'll enjoy the ride
A few things you gotta watch out for though, this is not your run of the mill food blog (We are better than that) there will be no images of the food described but an AI generated image that I will always try to make as closely as possible to the real thing so that you can compare what you had in mind with the generated image.

After this intro, let me start with the first meal, To set the stage we have, A very hot late August day, a very beautiful spanish city that Madrid is and lots of seafood.
We always hear the phrase that "This whatever dish would change your life" but for me this was true here, on that scorching hot afternoon my life changed for the worse though, knowing that I will never be able to experience that Paella again or something remotely close :(
It was from one of those tourist traps shops in the center of Madrid, this was not supposed to be tasty, I was the only person there, all the signs were not looking good, I was really sure I was gonna get ripped off with last night's Paella but to my surprise I got served this heavenly plate of sea fruits (that's how they call it in german and I am practicing in a weird way) with rice, The rice was orange and crispy, the mussels were staring me in the eyes daring me to take a bite, the smell sent me spiraling, the waiter was not so nice but who cares, I was at prom night wanting to ask this Prom queen for a dance, this made me feel stuff I never felt before.

> “but for me this was true here, on that scorching hot afternoon my life changed for the worse though, knowing that I will never be able to experience that Paella again.”

Now a bit of a disclaimer here, I never said that I was a food critic or that I know the good from the bad, I am a food enjoyer, I enjoy good food and I enjoy bad food and my mood and state of mind plays a huge part in this so what I will describe next might not sound like your grandma's Paella but I enjoyed it damn it, fight me ok.
ok let's start with the rice, it was a bit gummy with the cheese but not sticking to the pan at all, sprinkled in between was mussels,shrimps and some chickpeas with a lemon on the side to squeeze, after the first bite I was like hmmm this is interesting, everything tasted so fresh but hastily put together and that carelessness made the dish for me and proved to me an idea I have about food in general, if the ingredients are good and fresh you will have to screw up badly for it to not taste good.
As a tradition I want to start here there will be an AI generated image as the thumbnail and at the bottom to leave it to your imagination to see it.
